#The Issue
#I can login via the RDWeb interface on RDS01 from a Win10 desktop and connect to the published RDP 
#desktop without issue (i.e. no error messages to the user) and no errors in the logs.  When I try to directly
#RDP to RDS01, I successfully authenticate as a user (per the event log) but get an error stating that the user
#doesn't have access to the system.  In the event log I get event id 1306 with the message of "Remote
#Desktop Connection Broker Client failed to redirect the user <domain>\<test user>.  Error: NULL".  




#Soloution

For the RD Connection Broker do not redirect the session to RDSH in a new RDS environment, you need
configure the default collection on RDCB in registry.

You should create the registry value DefaultTsvUrl under the path below with tsv://MS Terminal Services Plugin.1.<collection alias> on RDCB.

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\ClusterSettings

For the value, you could find it in Event Viewer on RDCB like below
